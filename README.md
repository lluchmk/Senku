# Senku
Simple Senku game in Android.

The spheres are represented with RadioButtons. To make a move first touch the sphere to move, then touch the location.
If it's a valid move it will be done, if not, a Toast will inform that the move isn't allowed.
When achieving the winning state, which has a single sphere standing in the center, a Tost will congratulate the user informing of the amount of moves and the time spent.
